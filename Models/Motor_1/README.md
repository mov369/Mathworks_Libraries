PERMANENT MAGNETS
Permanent Magnet Major Properties:
[Br - Residual Induction]  - The magnetic flux that remains permanently in a magnet
[Hc and Hci - Coercivity] - Susceptibility for demagnetization of the magnet
[BHmax - Energy Product ] - Total energy stored in magnet [Br*Hc]
[T - Temperature Stability] - Reversible, irreversible, max working and Curie temps. 

Permanent Magnet Types:
-Neodymium (or Neo Rare Earth) [NdFeB]
(there are 4 subtypes - B10N, N52, N45SH, N38EH. Below are values )
Br = 12.5 (high = a lot of flux remains = good)
BH = 5.5 (low = weak = bad
Hc = 0.64-3 (low = easily demagnetised = bad)
T =  890 (high = can work at high temperatures = good)
-Samarium Cobalt [SmCo]

-Hard Ferrites or Ceramics [SrFe2O3]
(mostly used in motors and sensors)

-Alnico Magnets [AlNiCo]
Br = 12.5 (high = a lot of flux remains = good)
BH = 5.5 (low = weak = bad
Hc = 0.64-3 (low = easily demagnetised = bad)
T =  890 (high = can work at high temperatures = good)
